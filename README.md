# WUCCWEBSITE

This is a project to develop a website for Wharton Undergraduate Consulting Club. I designed the interface using Sketch, Photoshop and Figma, including how the pages should look like and what pages should there be. 

Then, I coded the website using HTML and CSS, completing page by page. Throughout the process, I have been learning more about HTML and CSS and has commanded more functionalities and properties of CSS. I am really excited to learn so many cool features of CSS and use them to decorate the website! I love this interacive learn-while-practicing process of website making. 

I am deeply passionate about designing in general, and I found it extremely satisfying to code the website I designed. which is to be used by thousands of users. I would continue learning CSS and JavaScript to make more cool websites in the future!
